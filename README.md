# Hi, I'm Ana 👋

A final-year Computer Science student with hands-on experience in tech since 2021, from robotics education to cloud support engineering at Atlassian (e-Core).

I'm passionate about building thoughtful, intelligent systems at the intersection of **data, automation, and AI**. My work blends **data engineering**, **ML development**, and **.NET backend systems** with a focus on performance, scalability, and real-world usability.

### 🧠 Interests & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, C#, C, SQL, JavaScript, Bash, C++
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: .NET, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Pandas, Express, JUnit
- **Data & Cloud Stack**: Apache Spark, Airflow, Kafka, Hadoop, AWS (Lambda, EC2, RDS), Docker, Databricks, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Power BI
- **Domains**: Data Engineering • Machine Learning • MLOps • Computer Vision • LLMs • Recommender Systems • DevOps • Prompt Engineering

### 📁 Featured Projects

Here you’ll find hands-on repositories and applied projects including:

- **[AWS Pharmacy Cost Reduction Platform](https://github.com/aryMello/aws-pharmacy-cost-reduction)** – Flask + AWS backend app for price optimization
- **[Reinforcement Learning & CV Agents](https://github.com/aryMello/hands-on-ai-cv)** – RL agents and real-time object detection
- **[IBM Data Engineering Capstone](https://github.com/aryMello/IBM-Data-Engineer-Capstone-Project)** – ETL pipeline with Spark, Airflow, and MongoDB
