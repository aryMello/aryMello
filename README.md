# Hi, I'm Ana!

**Artificial Intelligence Engineer @ [Indicum AI](https://indicium.ai/)**

*BS Computer Science • Postgraduate Student in AI & Deep Learning*

I am an engineer bridging the gap between academic research and production systems. Currently working in R&D, I specialize in designing AIOps frameworks for AI Agents and orchestrating MLOps lifecycles in multi-cloud environments.

My work focuses on the intersection of **Generative AI, Model Observability, and Data Engineering**, ensuring that intelligent systems are not only powerful, but measurable and reliable.

### Tech Stack

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Generative AI** | State of Art LLMs, AWS Bedrock, LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, RAG |
| **MLOps & Evaluation** | Databricks, MLflow, Agent Evaluation Frameworks, Pydantic |
| **Cloud & DevOps** | GCP, AWS (Lambda, EC2, SageMaker), Docker, Bitbucket (CI/CD), Git Bash |
| **Data Engineering** | Apache Spark, Airflow, Kafka, SQL, MongoDB |
| **Core Languages** | Python (SOTA libraries), .NET (C#), C++, Bash |

### Featured Projects

Here are selected projects demonstrating my engineering capability:

- **[SRAG Intelligent Analytics (Gemini)](https://github.com/aryMello/desafio-de-genAI)**
  *PoC for epidemiological surveillance using **Google Gemini**. Features RAG for real-time news correlation and privacy-preserving analysis.*

- **[Big Data ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/aryMello/IBM-Data-Engineer-Capstone-Project)**
  *End-to-end data engineering pipeline using Apache Spark, Airflow, and MongoDB to process and stage high-volume datasets.*

- **[AWS Cost Optimization](https://github.com/aryMello/aws-pharmacy-cost-reduction)**
  *Cloud-native application (Flask/AWS) designed to optimize pharmaceutical pricing structures and reduce infrastructure costs.*

- **[Deep Learning Research](https://github.com/aryMello/hands-on-ai-cv)**
  *Implementation of Reinforcement Learning agents and real-time Computer Vision systems.*

### Current R&D Focus

In my current role and postgraduate studies, I am deeply focused on:
- **Agent Evaluation:** Implementing metrics to benchmark LLM performance (hallucination rates, context precision, cost tracking).
- **Multi-Cloud AI:** Orchestrating models across GCP and AWS Bedrock for optimal performance/cost.
- **MLOps:** Managing the full lifecycle of models using MLflow and Databricks in enterprise workflows.
